**Please read this privacy policy to understand how we respect your privacy while still taking measures to stay competitive in the highly commercial internet of today**

_Updated May 24, 2018_

The Internet is above all a commercial space these days, not only referring to online purchasing of products, but primarily the huge marketing business in the web. All companies with a website provide such in order to benefit its business with the site. Our website is no different and we will explain to you in this hopefully friendlier than usual privacy policy how we treat personal information about you with respect and discretion while fulfilling our business goals. We actually try to involve personal info about you as little as possible. We do this out of our own desire and according to the general data protection regulations (GDPR) by the EU. We wish to treat our website visitors as well as we treat our employees, a matter that we have been positively recognized for and that we are very proud of. This policy applies to personal info gathered from our website as well as to all other personal info of our customers and potential future customers and employees that we have collected for running our business.

### We use Google Analytics and Tag Manager to track what our website visitors do

This is a fact we don’t try to hide in any way. It is quite openly visible in the source code of our website, which you can view using the developer options of Google’s Chrome browser. We do this in order to understand what content our website visitors like and what they possibly don’t find interesting. We can then put more efforts into creating content that is appreciated and is ideally also generating business for us. Likewise, we can put less focus on creating content that doesn’t seem to interest anybody and doesn’t seem to further our business. You can read all about Google’s privacy here (https://www.google.com/policies/privacy/), but that’s quite a long story. We can therefore more briefly ensure you that we do not get any personal information about you, not even an IP address, using Google’s tracking tools. We only see things like ‘this many (just a number) people have visited this page’, ‘that many clicked that link’ and ‘according to Google’s data that we have no access to, this many of our website visitors are located in the UK’. The same principle applies to other tracking tools and cookies that we may take in use. They give us valuable information about what our visitors have viewed and interacted with while at our website, but no info about who our website visitors are (read more at aboutcookies.org).

### We would like you to fill out our contact form and/or an application form for an open position at our company

These actions will naturally send us the information about yourself that you enter into the form. By submitting a form you grant us the right to store the information that you give us and any additional information that you may give to us in follow-up communication. Still, we only store what is necessary for the relationship with you and will delete it all when we no longer have any need for it. EU’s GDPR regulation grants you the right to at any point in time and at no charge:

Ask to see what personal information we have about you – all of it.
Correct any information about you that may have changed.
Get the personal information transferred, but this not that applicable for our service.
Restrict in some way the utilization of the personal information that we have about you.
‘To be forgotten’, meaning that all info about you will be eradicated.
There is a lot of legal text behind all this that you can read in a more easily approachable format in (https://gdpr-info.eu/). A convenient way to contact us regarding this can be found on our web page with the topic ‘Contact Us’.

### What we do with the personal information about you

If you represent a company that is our client or a potential future client of our company, we will enter your information into our customer relationship management system in order to contact you more easily. We may also add personal information about some of your colleagues when such is shared with us, if the business relationship between our companies benefit from it. When the relationship gets deeper, we may produce contracts and other documentation with your name and possibly other information on them, still the minimum amount of personal information needed. All personal data collected through this website will primarily be stored in cloud services utilized by our company, and these may reside outside of the EU/EEA.

### Data privacy and security

As a company providing web services for larger corporations and public administration, we consider ourselves experts regarding data privacy and data security. Without privacy and security regarding personal information there is no trust between us, which is a poor foundation for a relationship. We therefore keep ourselves informed of the evolution in data privacy and security and utilize the solutions that are at the same time most secure and most suitable for our needs. In case of a data breach, we will inform the subjects of the personal data compromised as soon as possible after detecting the breach. We will then cooperate with the persons in question to minimize any possible harm from the breach.

### Updates to this privacy policy

This privacy policy will be updated from time to time. This may occur because of a change in legislation, or because we have taken a new service in use that processes personal information. We will not spam all the people that we have personal information about regarding the update, we rather hope that you will take a look at this page on our website and the date in its topic. If the date seems newer than when you last read it, you should read it again in order to see if you agree with the renewed privacy policy. And as always, we would be delighted if you would let us know if there is something in this privacy policy that you don’t agree with. We may then be able to correct the situation enabling a continued relationship with you.

Thank you so much for taking the effort to read our privacy policy.
